# Welcome!

<left><img src="images/self_prof.jpg" width="308px" height="410px"></left>

Welcome and thank you for visiting my personal website! I'm J. Steven Raquel and I am pursuing a Master of Science in Statistics at the University of California, Irvine. 

Find out more about [who I am and what I've done](about_me.html).

If you know anything about statistics, biostatistics, machine learning, epidemiology, or public health, feel free to get in touch with me! I have a lot to learn so I'm eager to touch base with folks with similar interests. You can find my email, GitHub and LinkedIn under Contact Me in the header.

## Projects  

These are some of the projects I've worked on throughout my time studying statistics, and I am constantly learning and adding things to my repertoire.

* #### [Spatial modeling the incidences of gun violence in K-12 schools](matern-spatial.html)

This paper was written for STATS 295 Spatial Statistics and showcases the usage of a Matern cluster point process to model the incidence of gun violence in K-12 schools between the years of 1990-2019. 

* #### [Exponential random graph modeling (ERGM) for a sexual social network](ergm_models.html)

This paper was written for Sociology 280 and uses exponential random graph modeling to model (and simulate) the ties of a sexual social network in an indigenous community in Alberta, Canada, in which a gonorrhea outbreak had occurred. 


* #### [Classification algorithm comparison for wine quality](wine-classification.html)

For my final project for Statistics 131 Data Mining, I used and compared the decision tree, randomForest and k-Nearest Neighbors algorithms using R to determine the quality of a wine and what the best algorithm was for classification. I also came to determine what attributes were most important towards a good wine.

* #### [Predicting housing prices in Boston](housing-prices.html)

This project utilizes various regression algorithms including ordinary least squares regression, decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, and gradient boosting in Python to create a regression model using various attributes of the housing market in Boston. 

* #### [Time series forecasting cryptocurrency value](bitcoin.html)

For my final project in PSTAT 147 Time Series, I attempted to apply the Box-Jenkins ARIMA model using R to several observations of the opening price of the cryptocurrency known as bitcoin. It turned out that the variability of the data was too sporadic and unpredictable, and ultimately I concluded that the GARCH model was most likely better because it accounts for the heteroskedasticity. While I did not fit that GARCH model I did fit a couple of ARIMA models and forecasted with them.

### Packages and Shiny Apps

* #### [Play Gomoku (Five in a Row)](https://pinchunchen.shinyapps.io/ggomoku/)

Together with my partner [Pin-Chun Chen](https://sites.uci.edu/pinchunchen/), we designed an R package called `ggomoku` that allowed you to play the board game [Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku). The source code for the package can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/stats295r-fa20/package-group11).

We later ported this game over to the Shiny framework in R, which allowed the game to be playable on the web without loading the package in R. It's deployed on [shinyapps.io](https://pinchunchen.shinyapps.io/ggomoku/). The source code for this Shiny app can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/stats295r-fa20/shiny-group2).
