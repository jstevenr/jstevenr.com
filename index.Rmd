# Welcome!

Thanks for visiting my personal website. I'm J Steven Raquel and am pursuing a Master of Science in Statistics at the University of California, Irvine.

Find out more about [who I am and what I've done](about_me.html).

If you know anything about data science, statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or computer science, feel free to get in touch with me! I have a lot to learn so I'm eager to touch base with folks with similar interests. You can find my email, GitHub and LinkedIn under Contact Me in the header.

## Projects  

These are some of the projects I've worked on throughout my time studying data science, and I am constantly learning and adding things to my repertoire.


### Machine Learning

* #### [Classifying wine quality](wine-classification.html)

For my final project for PSTAT 131 Data Mining, I used and compared the decision tree, randomForest and k-Nearest Neighbors algorithms using R to determine the quality of a wine and what the best algorithm was for classification. I also came to determine what attributes were most important towards a good wine.

* #### [Predicting housing prices in Boston](https://github.com/jstevenr/housing-price-regression/blob/master/housing-prices.ipynb)

This project utilizes various regression algorithms including ordinary least squares regression, decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, and gradient boosting in Python to create a regression model using various attributes of the housing market in Boston. 

### Time Series Forecasting

* #### [Forecasting bitcoin price](bitcoin.html)

For my final project in PSTAT 147 Time Series, I attempted to apply the Box-Jenkins ARIMA model using R to several observations of the opening price of the cryptocurrency known as bitcoin. It turned out that the variability of the data was too sporadic and unpredictable, and ultimately I concluded that the GARCH model was most likely better because it accounts for the heteroskedasticity. While I did not fit that GARCH model I did fit a couple of ARIMA models and forecasted with them.

### Data Visualization

* #### [Visualizing IMDB ratings](imdb.html)

This is a simple visualization of film ratings on the [Internet Movie Database](imdb.com) in R, particularly focusing on the separate decades and the best and worst of each, as well as the trend of film ratings in general.

### Packages and Shiny Apps

* #### [Play Gomoku (Five in a Row)](https://pinchunchen.shinyapps.io/ggomoku/)

Together with my partner [Pin-Chun Chen](https://sites.uci.edu/pinchunchen/), we designed an R package called `ggomoku` that allowed you to play the board game [Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku). The source code for the package can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/stats295r-fa20/package-group11).

We later ported this game over to the Shiny framework in R, which allowed the game to be playable on the web without loading the package in R. It's deployed on [shinyapps.io](https://pinchunchen.shinyapps.io/ggomoku/). The source code for this Shiny app can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/stats295r-fa20/shiny-group2).
