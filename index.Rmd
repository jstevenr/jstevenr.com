Welcome and thank you for visiting my website! My name is J. Steven Raquel and I am proud to call myself a scientist who makes a difference. I currently work with the State of California's Department of Social Services in the Analysis and Modeling Unit within the Research, Automation, and Data Division. I graduated from the University of California, Irvine with an M.S. in Statistics in 2023, and from the University of California, Santa Barbara, with a B.S. in Statistical Science in 2018. 

Find out more about [who I am](about_me.html) and [what I've done](resume.html).

## Projects  

These are some of the projects I've worked on throughout my time studying statistics.

* #### [Modeling human serum albumin's association with mortality among end stage renal disease patients](esrd-survival.html)

I conducted a comprehensive survival analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model to investigate the association between mortality and human serum albumin levels, accounting for confounding variables such as smoking history and body mass index.

* #### [Spatial modeling the incidences of gun violence in K-12 schools](matern-spatial.html)

I developed a Matern cluster process model to study the incidence of gun violence in K-12 schools across the United States. Employed spatial statistics techniques to identify patterns and factors contributing to gun violence occurrences.

* #### [Exponential random graph modeling (ERGM) for a sexual social network](ergm_models.html)

I applied an exponential random graph model (ERGM) to analyze and simulate the spread of gonorrhea in a First Nations community in Alberta, Canada. Examined network structures and social factors influencing disease transmission.


* #### [Classification algorithm comparison for wine quality](wine-classification.html)

I utilized decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest algorithms in R to predict wine quality based on various wine attributes. Conducted feature selection, model training, and evaluation to develop accurate classification models.

* #### [Predicting housing prices in Boston](housing-prices.html)

I utilized various regression algorithms including ordinary least squares regression, decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, and gradient boosting in Python to create a regression model using various attributes of the housing market in Boston. 

* #### [Time series forecasting cryptocurrency value](bitcoin.html)

I applied the Box-Jenkins ARIMA model using R to several observations of the opening price of the cryptocurrency known as bitcoin. It turned out that the variability of the data was too sporadic and unpredictable, and ultimately I concluded that the GARCH model was most likely better because it accounts for the heteroskedasticity. While I did not fit that GARCH model I did fit a couple of ARIMA models and forecasted with them.

### Packages and Shiny Apps

* #### canectar: Draw elegant maps of California in the shape of a honeycomb

I authored a package in R that utilized spatial data frames from the `sf` package and the visualization capabilities of the `tmap` package for the purpose of drawing county-level hexbin plots in the shape of the state of California. 

* #### [Play Gomoku (Five in a Row)](ggomoku.html)

Together with my partner [Pin-Chun Chen](https://sites.uci.edu/pinchunchen/), we designed an R package called `ggomoku` that allowed you to play the board game [Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku). The source code for the package can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/stats295r-fa20/package-group11).

We later ported this game over to the Shiny framework in R, which allowed the game to be playable on the web without loading the package in R. It's deployed on [shinyapps.io](https://pinchunchen.shinyapps.io/ggomoku/). The source code for this Shiny app can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/stats295r-fa20/shiny-group2).
