### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1) How did you get into the statistics field?**

I started out as a pre-economics major when I was a first-year at UC Santa Barbara. At some point I ended up switching into the pre-financial math and statistics track and enjoyed the math/statistics coursework so much that I eventually switched into the full statistics degree. During my master's program, doing full-time research under a professor in the department of public policy as a statistics master student inspired me to shift my career focus to public policy.

**2) What does the J in your name stand for? What do you prefer to go by?**

Legally, the J has no meaning! "J. Steven" is my legal first name. My paternal grandfather's name was Juan, and his father's name was Esteban, so I was named in honor of both of them. Most of my friends/acquaintances call me J, but my family/colleagues call me Steven. Feel free to refer to me as you please.

**3) What are your other interests / what do you like to do in your free time?**

In my free time I am an avid gamer and I like to study languages such as Spanish and Portuguese. Among my other interests are world history, culture, and specialty coffee. I am also a proud uncle to my niece and nephew.
