### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1) How did you get into the statistics field?**

I started out as a pre-economics major when I was a first-year at UC Santa Barbara. At some point I ended up switching into the pre-financial math and statistics track and enjoyed the math/statistics coursework so much that I eventually switched into the full statistics degree. An infectious diseases course I took as a second-year Masters student inspired me to shift my career focus towards biostatistics and public health.

**2) What does the J in your name stand for? What do you prefer to go by?**

Legally, the J has no meaning! "J. Steven" is my legal first name. My paternal grandfather's name started with J, and his father's name was Esteban-- my name is an homage to them both. Most of my friends/acquaintances call me J, but my family calls me Steven. You are free to refer to me either way that you like!

**3) What are your other interests / what do you like to do in your free time?**

In my free time I am an avid gamer and I like to study languages such as Spanish and Portuguese. Among my other interests are world history, culture, and specialty coffee. I am also a proud uncle to my niece and nephew.
